    "\n",
    "Yelp is an online service in which anyone can comment and/or rate any business on a range from 0 to 5 stars. Users can then describe the business from a range of various factors such as cleanliness, customer service and other amenities as well as upload any photos. We want to find in our data if a specific location such as the area and neighborhoods affects the rating of a particular restaurant. \n",

    "Notes:\n",
    "- How corrupt is Yelp? (How much ‘weight’ should you put on a yelp review?)\n",
    "   - What gets filtered out? (criteria) \n",
    "   - Filter’s effects of score (reference #1) \n",
    "   - Paying to hide bad reviews and highlight good ones (reference #4)\n",

    "   - Does current rating affect future ratings? \n",

    "      - Highlighted extreme ratings affect overall ratings more \n",
    "   - How does this affect small businesses vs. large businesses?\n",
    "      - Large businesses get more ratings than small businesses, and may be more vulnerable to such an effect \n",
    "   - How does demographic / area of interest affect ratings? \n",
    "      - E.g., we expect San Diego to have a higher quality standard for Mexican food than New York. Chipotle in San Diego may be lower rated than Chipotle in New York. \n",
    "      - Do older reviews have less weight to them? How is Yelp’s average review score calculated?\n",
    "      - How does location affect the rating of restaurants? Can you predict a restaurant’s success based off of location? How do tendencies of a certain location affect ratings? \n",
    "          - Such as chain restaurants vs local mom and pop \n",
    "          - Chain restaurants == control group\n",

    "### Prior Work\n",
    "While researching our project we came across the Yelp Dataset Challenge. A couple in particular had to do with predicting the ratings of restaurants based on the text in the reviews which were analyzed based on sentiment (reference #5) using machine learning models. However we could not find any projects or reports that looked into the effect of different locations on the ratings of restaurants which is why we thought it would be an interesting topic to focus on."

    "The ideal dataset would include multiple reviews from both local and chain restaurants from multiple similar regions / areas. This data ideally would be collected without emphasis on certain types of reviews (without the influence of yelp’s advertisement services). In addition, the data will be collected by utilizing Yelp’s API to get access to their data. Yelp also has a 'Yelp Dataset Challenge' which provides a link to a downloadable JSON dataset. The data will ideally be organized based on region, size of business, and amount of reviews. We also need information on how reviews change over time. The data will be stored by utilizing the data wrangling method presented in lecture.\n"
