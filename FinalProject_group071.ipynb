    "Yelp has normalized the reviewing of businesses. This system has benefited its users by allowing them to read on other people’s experiences and opinions, along with updating them on the business’s amenities. This can be either problematic or valuable to businesses. It allows them to receive feedback on how to improve their business and either attracts or dissuades potential customers. In the modern day, Yelp tends to play a factor in and reflect a business’s success. Our project analyzes Yelp data to determine the effects of a business’s location on a business’s success (based off the area and environment it is in). This analysis is used to determine the likelihood of a business’s success based on the location it is set up in. "

    "Yelp is an online service in which anyone with an account can comment on and/or rate a business. It allows users to make informed decisions on whether or not they want to receive services from them. For businesses, it is a platform for them to receive feedback on their services, such as what customers would like to see and what improvements they can make. This platform is used by both sides to gauge how successful and/or promising a business is. As such, we focus on Yelp data to help us determine the success of a restaurant (determined by ratings and number of reviews) based on location. \n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating whether a Yelp data set is the most appropriate for our question, we analyzed the credibility and bias of the dataset. We researched possible factors that could affect the accuracy of the dataset in reflecting the success of a restaurant. One major question we asked is: “Is the data corrupt?”. Upon further research, we found that Yelp does manipulate reviews. They filter out data that they think are fake, but this algorithm is not always correct. The filter affects the success because it is manipulating the data, thus removing data that could potentially affect the ratings of the business. In addition, they accept payments from businesses to advertise for them and/or hide bad reviews while highlighting more favorable ones. This would skew the data because it means that restaurants who pay Yelp to do this are more likely to receive more customers and reviews, thus making the business (seem) more successful than its competitors. Another major aspect we considered was how the bandwagon effect could affect the ratings of a restaurant. We found that current ratings do affect future ratings, which further cements the skew of the data. This affects small businesses, as they are often overshadowed by larger businesses who have the resources to pay Yelp for advertisements and extra services. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have decided to move forward with using the Yelp dataset with these concerns in mind. We concluded that while these factors may affect the accuracy in reflecting the success of a restaurant, they also affect the success of the restaurant. These factors change the way the business is reflected through Yelp, a popular platform used by people to determine whether or not they want to utilize the business’s services. By playing a role in a potential customer’s choice in utilizing the service, Yelp indirectly affects the success of the restaurant. Therefore, it is safe to continue using the Yelp dataset, given that these factors also influence the restaurant’s success. \n",
    "\n",
    "While doing initial research on Yelp dataset, we came across the Yelp Dataset Challenge. We noticed 2-3 projects that had to do with predicting the success of a business. For example, one project predicted success based on the text in the reviews which were analyzed based on sentiment (reference #5) using machine learning models. However, we could not find any projects or reports that looked into the effect of different locations on the ratings of restaurants which is why we thought it would be an interesting topic to focus on. \n",

    "3. Normally distributed: This is debatable. The first thing that we need to consider is the nature of our data. Within a particular cuisine, we have a set of restaurants which each have a rating that is a multiple of 0.5. This multiple of 0.5 is obtained by aggregating individual reviews of that restaurant which range from 1 to 5 stars. These reviews are averaged and then rounded to the nearest multiple of 0.5. When using normaltest with an alpha value of 0.05, American, Mexican, and Japanese cuisines did not pass. This result might be a result of rounding error: It's possible that when considering pre-rounded ratings, we had a normal distribution with a very low standard deviation, but rounding clumped up most of our data into a few bins. We will further explore the normality of these 3 cases below. \n",

    "In order to gain access to the data, we utilized several Yelp API keys at no charge. Anyone is able to  obtain the available data on Yelp, therefore we do have permission to use it. The API however does not return every business available, only the businesses that have Yelp-user generated content. In addition, we only found data for 48 states in which we’re missing the data for Arizona and Delaware. This is concerning because it excludes these populations. In addition, it seems that the restaurants listed in the yelp dataset do not include all ethnic groups (ex: there are no Korean restaurants listed). Furthermore, there are biases in our dataset because the data (reviews) is manipulated by Yelp and does not reflect the overall ratings of everyone who has written a review. In terms of privacy, our project should not have any major concerns as we are using information that has been released to the public, all which do not contain personal information. The data we are working with are on businesses, such as their location and amount of reviews. \n",
    " \n",
    "While our dataset has a potential bias, we have decided to continue on with using it. Our dataset may be missing 2 states, but we felt that missing 2 out of 50 states would not significantly change our results and analysis. One thing we must note is that we would be unable to predict the success of a restaurant if the location given were to be in Arizona or Delaware. We must also note that our prediction of a restaurant's success may be inaccurate for restaurants who identify as any of the ethnic groups not represented by the dataset. We have also decided to overlook Yelp’s manipulation of the reviews because it is also a factor that plays a role in the success or failure of a business, as mentioned in the Background and Prior Work section. In addition, there is little we can do about Yelp’s manipulation of data, as we only have permission to data that Yelp has legally consented to publicizing. \n"
