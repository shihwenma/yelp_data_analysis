So we are now in the process of trying to figure out use the Yelp API to obtain the data we need to answer our question."

For example, New York only had 10 restaurants while Nevada had around 4,000 restuarants and the data also only included a few restaurants in California. So now we are faced with either changing our question so that we can use the dataset or figure our how to use the Yelp API to get the data we need. We would like to keep our research question and are trying to seek help on how to use the API."
