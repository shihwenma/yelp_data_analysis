    "Yelp has normalized the reviewing of businesses. This system has benefited its users by allowing them to read on other people’s experiences and opinions, along with updating them on the business’s amenities. This can be either problematic or valuable to businesses. It allows them to receive feedback on how to improve their business and either attracts or dissuades potential customers. In the modern day, Yelp tends to play a factor in and reflect a business’s success. Our project analyzes Yelp data to determine the effects of a business’s location on a business’s success (based off the area and environment it is in). This analysis is used to determine the likelihood of a business’s success based on the location it is set up in. "

    "Yelp is an online service in which anyone with an account can comment on and/or rate a business. It allows users to make informed decisions on whether or not they want to receive services from them. For businesses, it is a platform for them to receive feedback on their services, such as what customers would like to see and what improvements they can make. This platform is used by both sides to gauge how successful and/or promising a business is. As such, we focus on Yelp data to help us determine the success of a restaurant (determined by ratings and number of reviews) based on location. \n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating whether a Yelp data set is the most appropriate for our question, we analyzed the credibility and bias of the dataset. We researched possible factors that could affect the accuracy of the dataset in reflecting the success of a restaurant. One major question we asked is: “Is the data corrupt?”. Upon further research, we found that Yelp does manipulate reviews. They filter out data that they think are fake, but this algorithm is not always correct. The filter affects the success because it is manipulating the data, thus removing data that could potentially affect the ratings of the business. In addition, they accept payments from businesses to advertise for them and/or hide bad reviews while highlighting more favorable ones. This would skew the data because it means that restaurants who pay Yelp to do this are more likely to receive more customers and reviews, thus making the business (seem) more successful than its competitors. Another major aspect we considered was how the bandwagon effect could affect the ratings of a restaurant. We found that current ratings do affect future ratings, which further cements the skew of the data. This affects small businesses, as they are often overshadowed by larger businesses who have the resources to pay Yelp for advertisements and extra services. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have decided to move forward with using the Yelp dataset with these concerns in mind. We concluded that while these factors may affect the accuracy in reflecting the success of a restaurant, they also affect the success of the restaurant. These factors change the way the business is reflected through Yelp, a popular platform used by people to determine whether or not they want to utilize the business’s services. By playing a role in a potential customer’s choice in utilizing the service, Yelp indirectly affects the success of the restaurant. Therefore, it is safe to continue using the Yelp dataset, given that these factors also influence the restaurant’s success. \n",
    "\n",
    "While doing initial research on Yelp dataset, we came across the Yelp Dataset Challenge. We noticed 2-3 projects that had to do with predicting the success of a business. For example, one project predicted success based on the text in the reviews which were analyzed based on sentiment (reference #5) using machine learning models. However, we could not find any projects or reports that looked into the effect of different locations on the ratings of restaurants which is why we thought it would be an interesting topic to focus on. \n",

    "Location will have a large effect on the rating because it sets up the environment and customer expectations the business needs to fulfill. The most popular type of food in a specific area will be set at a higher standard by the consumers and therefore have harsher ratings. For example, we believe that if Mexican food is very popular in San Diego, then Chipotle chain restaurants, known for its Mexican-style cuisine, will generally have lower ratings due to the fact that there are more local restaurants that specialize in Mexican food. Therefore, we will also place an emphasis on chain restaurants and compare our findings to local restaurants. "
