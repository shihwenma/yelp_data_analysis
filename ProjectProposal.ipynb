Similarly, the ratings of highlighted reviews affect how users will review a restaurant.

This data ideally would be collected without emphasis on certain types of reviews (without the influence of yelp’s advertisement services). In addition, the data will be collected by utilizing Yelp’s API to get access to their data. Yelp also has a 'Yelp Dataset Challenge' which provides a link to a downloadable JSON dataset. The data will ideally be organized based on region, size of business, and amount of reviews. We also need information on how reviews change over time. The data will be stored by utilizing the data wrangling method presented in lecture."
